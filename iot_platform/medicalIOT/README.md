Welcome to the Django development project. Please 
read this file for a general context of this project.

The script 'manage.py' is the main script. Whenever we
want to run the project to test it we will need to type
the following command: 'python manage.py runserver'. You can 
refer to that script for further next steps
*please note that you need to have active your virtual
environment first

In case you need a different command you can type 
'django-admin' in the terminal (either in VS code, 
PyCharm, or your CMD) and it will list all the commands
that you can use with python, the sintaxis is:
'python manage.py (desired command)'

The folder 'medicalIOT' is the main folder created initially
by Django, and the folder 'IoTCloud' is the application that
we are creating. (please refer first to medicalIOT, the main
folder, and then to the app IoTCloud)

The main work is held in the 'IoTCloud' folder, there you can find
the scripts needed for the front end and back end development.

# In case you need more information, you can check the scripts '__init__.py' where IÂ´ve put more information and notes.
