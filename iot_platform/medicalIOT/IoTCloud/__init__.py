"""To begin, we can check the scripts 'views' and 'urls' of this folder. The 'urls.py' script contains all the
   information of the paths or urls that the application will be using. All the posible urls that the users can access
   will be listed in that script

   Moving forward, the script 'views.py' will be the responsible for rendering the view (the front end response) that
   the user will be seing on his side."""
