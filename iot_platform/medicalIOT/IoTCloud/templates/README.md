The folder 'templates' of the application 'IoTCloud' will contain
all the html files. The HTML files can be found in the folder 'iot_temp' which means 
'iot templates'.

In oder to avoid having excesive or duplicated information in the HMLT
documents, the style (CSS) document will be in the folder 'static/css'
and a 'father' HTML will be created (base_script) which will inherit
the main structure to other documents.

Please refer to additional comments in the HTML scripts.
