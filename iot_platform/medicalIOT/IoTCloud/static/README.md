The folder 'static' of the application 'IoTCloud' will contain all 
the CSS, images and JS files. The HTML files can be found in the folder
'iot_temp' which means 'iot templates' inside the 'templates' folder.

Regarding the STATIC FOLDER:
 - The images can be found in the Google Drive, it is not a good practice to include images in a GitHub
   repository
 - The CSS folder contains the cascade style sheets used for the fronend of the server
 - The js folder contains all the JavaScript scripts, although currently it is empty
