# MSCapp
Medical cloud services iot app. Developed with the purpose of 
providing an integrated service to hospitals and clinics where 
they can have all the information of their patients in real time
and stored in the cloud. 

Project developed by:
- Ing. Federico Gonz√°lez
- Ing. Cesar Arias
- Ing. Antonio Gomez


For the Django development project, please refer to the folder 
'iot_platform'. In this folder we have the Django project 'medicalIOT'
and the app 'IoTCloud' Please read its own 'README' document for more 
regarding that project and its content. 

For the oximeter with IoT connection, please refer to the folder
'AWS_prueba_tony'. Please note that this folder is not for python 
development, it contains a C+ script used for the Arduino environment.
That code is the one needed for the prototype using the ESP32 or
ESP8266 board with IoT connection. 

The individual scripts are separated tests to do the OCR (optical 
character recognition).Currently, each individual script is used for a 
particular functionality test. In a further version an only script will
be made integrating all this individual functionalities.

In case a push will be done, and you have added images to the repository
for testing purposes, please add all the images to the '.gitignore' 
document. All the images will be in the team's Google Drive, no image
should be loaded to the repository

Final notes: When you clone this repository, you will need to create a 
virtual environment with the needed libraries.
